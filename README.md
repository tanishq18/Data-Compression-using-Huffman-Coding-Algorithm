# Data-Compression-using-Huffman-Coding-Algorithm

Problem Statement<br>
• Data Compression using Huffman Coding Algorithm

Data Structures Used<br>
• Binary Trees and Priority Queues

Why I chose these for my project.?<br>
• I was fed up with “low storage space available” popups, thus wanted to work on data compression technology.<br>
• To get started, I decided to implement a data compressor using Huffman coding algorithm for this project.<br>
• Since this algorithm used Binary Trees and Priority Queues, I had to work using Binary Trees and Priority Queues.

Features present:<br>

Process File<br>
• Reads any type of file<br>
• Reads any size of file<br>
• File has to be in the root folder<br>

Compression<br>
• Compresses any size of text file<br>
• Compresses any type of text file<br>
• Even .html files<br>
• Can even compress small images<br>
• Output file is output.txt<br>

Decompression<br>
• Decompresses any compressed text file<br>
• Compressed file should be a .txt file<br>
• Output is output.txt<br>
